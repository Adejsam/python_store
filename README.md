Hello,

This project is to simulate an online store using only python.
This is the first project I completed after learning the Basics of python.

The items, item prices and item quantity in the store are stored in a dictionary and the user can make request based on this data. The user can choose whether to view
the items avialable in the store, make a purchase or exit the store. When the user is making a purchase, he/she can add items to his/her cart as long as the quantity is not more than 
the available quantity in the store and the item is avialable in the store. 

Once the user confirms his/her order, a reciept is printed and data is appended to a css file so as to enable the seller/owner of the store view transactions performed at the end of the day
